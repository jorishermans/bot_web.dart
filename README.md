# The Dart Bag-of-Tricks - Web
## A collection of (mostly) general libraries to make working with [Dart](http://www.dartlang.org/) more productive.

Starting by porting bits of the [PL javascript library](https://github.com/thinkpixellab/pl) and Google's [Closure javascript library](https://developers.google.com/closure/library/) to enable some interesting scenarios.
